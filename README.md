Hi! If you're seeing *this* message in particular, you're here early! Like... super early. Early enough that I don't quite have this fully together yet!

I plan on creating this a website to house a sort of 'digital portfolio', with examples of my work (designs, artwork, props, costumes, game designs, stuff like that) but uh... we're still working on coding it

So check back in soon! Hopefully there'll be more to see then :)
